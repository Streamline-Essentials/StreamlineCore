Streamline is a useful and powerful essentials plugin for Velocity, BungeeCord, Travertine, or Waterfall making it easy an feasible to transfer from one style of proxy to another (i.e. BungeeCord to Velocity or vis versa).
It offers:
Configurations for everything; making it so you can customize your server the way you want.
All commands are completely configurable from their messages to their label, aliases, and even permissions!
Module support; thus allowing for complete customizability of what your server does and how it functions. Only want a few features? Add only the modules you want! Want ALL the features? Add all of the modules!
Possibility for (with modules):
Complete and total Discord integration. Connect your Minecraft server network and all of its servers with Discord and vis versa.
Aliases that even have configurable suggestions for their arguments. Want to make a long command into a short command? Want to run a bunch of commands with one short and simple command? You can do that with aliases!
A group functionality that adds Guilds and Parties! These Guilds and Parties act like the Guilds and Parties of Hypixel. And you can configure the amount of experience you gain, how fast you gain it, and the equation it runs to check if it needs to level up!
Placeholder API for Proxy servers. Our RAT API (Replace A Thing API) allows you to make custom placeholders that mimic the functionality of the spigot plugin PlaceholderAPI.
Modules can be downloaded from here (or on the Discord!): https://www.mediafire.com/folder/fmduksvzxqlcu/modules



Currently a work in progress, but should be getting worked on next!
